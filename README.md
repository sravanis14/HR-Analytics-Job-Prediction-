# HR-Analytics-Job-Prediction-

This capstone project is an opportunity to analyze a dataset and build predictive models that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm whether or not an employee will leave the company. If we can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
